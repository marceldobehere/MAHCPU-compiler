# MAHCPU-compiler
This is a compiler to compile human readable code into MAHCPU "machine" code


Its written in c# and theres an exe file.

There also is documentation but its in german (gotta translate it)

BTW its still WIP since there are atleast a few commands missing (like getting a pixel from the screen or maybe inserting raw code)
